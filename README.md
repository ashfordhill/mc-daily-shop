# ShopGUIPlus + HeadDatabase Shop Refresher
Uses the [GuiShop API](https://github.com/brcdev-minecraft/shopgui-api]) and 
[HeadDatabase API](https://github.com/Arcaniax-Development/HeadDatabase-API) to randomize custom head stocking for a single shop on a configurable interval.

## Installation
1. Make sure ShopGUIPlus and HeadDatabase are installed in plugins.
2. Create a `[shop-name].yml` and put in `ShopGUIPlus\shop` directory
     - The initial items don't matter, they will be overwritten
     - `shop-name` in this plugin's config should == the name of the `.yml` file
3. Configure this plugin as necessary. The economy type is determined by ShopGUIPlus' configuration.
